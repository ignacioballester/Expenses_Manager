# Expenses Manager

##### CLI python program to keep track of expenses.
<p>
Since TransferWise does not have any features to analyze your expenses, 
I developed this python project to manage my account expenses. 
It uses the exported csv file from TransferWise with the account 
movements to provide summaries and graphs of the information.

#### Features
<p> Following commands are accepted:  </p>

* **expyear y (returns expenses of year y per month)

* **expcat (optional: category) (prints expenses by category)
